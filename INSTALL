Linux
=====

Download the Qt 4 development kit (more than likely that your distro provides
packages). Visruled is *not* compatible with Qt 5.

In a terminal, navigate to the source directory and type:
$ qmake
$ make
$ sudo make install

NOTE: On Linux, the visual rule editor must be installed to run properly!

Windows
=======

Download the Qt 4 development kit (http://qt-project.org). Visruled is *not*
compatible with Qt 5.

Setting up the build enviroment on Windows is much less straightforward
compared to Linux; I advise that you download Qt Creator as well, which will
take care of PATH and such annoyances.

Once you have Creator, open apertium-visruled.pro. You can compile and run the
application with the big green "Run" button.

NOTE: On Windows, the visual rule editor must be run from the build directory
to work properly! If you're not sure what that means, just stick to Creator's
"Run" button; that will work.

OSX

The Linux way probably works, but it's untested. Feedback elcome.
